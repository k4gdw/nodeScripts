# nodeScripts

This repository contains any javascript files I create or find useful enough to
download from the internet to be included. In the latter case, I will give
the author/owner proper attribution as well as include their license file or at
least include a link to license as well as the link to the original source.

## My Scripts

These are scripts that I have written or heavily modified for my own use.

* `getNodeGit.js` - This file was created by me while working through an online
  tutorial for [`nodeGit.js`][1] which I will add as a sub-repository once I
  refresh my memory on how to actually create a sub-repository.
  TODO: create nodeGit sub-repository.
